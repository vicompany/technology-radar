# Contributing

The files containing all items exist in the directory `/docs/data`. The filenames follow the following format: `yyyy-mm.json`. By grouping the additions, deletions and changes per month, an archive is built.

## Use proper names

Use the “official” name used by the author. This includes casing.

## Order the items alphabetically

Keeping the list ordered alphabetically makes it much easier to search existing items.
